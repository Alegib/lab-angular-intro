  $ npm install
  $ npm run dev
  ```

<!-- ## Getting Started -->

## Instructions

### Iteration 1 | Get HTML template

For this lab, you'll have to download the following HTML template ([asperion-html5-template](https://github.com/ironhack-labs/lesson-code-java-lab-7.02-template)).

### Iteration 2 | Create a new Angular project

Pretty straight forward. If needed, reference the Student Portal or class materials.

### Iteration 3 | Setup

In this iteration, you'll import all the CSS and JS from the downloaded template and add it globally in your project.

### Iteration 4 | HTML to components

Next, separate the content of the `index.html` into different components and replicate the page on your Angular project (ignore the navigation links and functionalities).

### Iteration 5 | Events (Alert message)

Using event binding override the "more" button and display an alert message when the button is clicked.

### Iteration 6 | Events (Warning message)

When you try to copy any of the titles, display a warning message.
